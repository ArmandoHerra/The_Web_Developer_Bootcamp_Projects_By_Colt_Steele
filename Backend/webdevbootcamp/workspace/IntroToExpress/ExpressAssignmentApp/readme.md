#Expres Routing Assignment.

1.- Create a brand new Express app from scratch.
2.- Create a package.json using 'npm init' and add express as a dependancy.
3.- In your main app.js file, add 3 different routes:

Visiting "/" should print "Hi there, welcome to my Express Routing Assignment."
===============================================================================
Visiting "/speak/pig" should print "The pig says 'Oink'".
Visiting "/speak/cow" should print "The cow says 'Moo'".
Visiting "/speak/dog" should print "The dog says 'Woof Woof!'"
===============================================================================
Visiting "/repeat/hello/3" should print "hello" 3 times.
Visiting "/repeat/hello/5" should print "hello" 5 times.
Visiting "/repeat/blah/2" should print "blah" 2 times.

If a user visits any other route, print:
"Sorry, page not found... What are you doing with your life?".
